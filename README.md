## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Doramas Baez Bernal, a Machine Learning Engineer passionate about creating innovative solutions in computer vision and natural language processing.

### Expertise:
My work focuses on state-of-the-art Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), including:
- Training and fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) and embedding models.
- Developing real-world applications using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems.
- Integrating textual, visual, and multimodal data with Information Retrieval and Multimodal Knowledge Representation (Multimodal models).
- Neural video compression algorithms to optimize data storage and transmission.
- Neural radiance fields for advanced 3D reconstruction.
- Exploring dynamic radiance fields (4D).

### Projects:
Some of my notable projects include:
- Building scalable multimodal search engines and efficient language processing systems.
- Real-time rendering of radiance fields (before Gaussian splattings).

Iâ€™m always excited to connect with professionals, exchange ideas, and explore new opportunities in the AI field!
